Vim Marionettist
================

A Vim plugin to make working with Wikimedia's Puppet repos nicer.

Features
--------

* Marionettist_LoadFile : Try to find a manifest, file, or template based on
  the provided string. Bound to `<E>` (for edit) in normal mode with `<cfile>`
  as the input. Also mapped to `:E ...`. Folks who are not used to this
  particular mapping might choose to override `gf` to do the same thing.
